Talagala 2020-11-02 Course Syllabus Module Code: MA 5124 Title: Financial Time Series Analysis &amp; Forecasting Credits: 4 Pre-requiites None Learning Objectives The purpose of this course is to provide students with introductory tools for the time series analysis of financial time series. Analyze of data series based on stochastic and non stochastic models Learning Outcomes On successful completion of this course, students will be able to provide more than an introductory treatment of the topics. Students are encouraged to pursue further study in this area if they find that the topics covered in this course. Outline Syllabus Definition and examples of time series back-shift and differencing-operators, - strong and weak stationarity, definition of ACF, PACF. Definitions and properties of the \\(MA(q), MA(\\infty), AR(p), AR(\\infty)\\) and \\(ARMA(p,q)\\),in particualr their acfâ€™s causal stationarity of AR invertibility of MA models and causal stationarity and invertibility of ARMA; - concept of spectral density function and its applications definition and properties of integrated \\(ARIMA(p,d,q)\\) processes definition and properties of random walks with or without drift. Model selection following the AIC and BIC brief introduction to linear prediction and calculation of forecasting intervals for normal ARMA models point and interval forecasts for normal random walks with or without drift. Definition and properties of the VAR (vector autoregressive) model, arrange a univariate time series as a multivariate Markov model. Nonlinear properties of financial time series definition and properties of the well known ARCH, GARCH etc. Cointegration in Single Equations, Modeling and Forecasting Financial Time Series. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).
